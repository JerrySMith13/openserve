--- General Layout for database ---
For both pending submissions and accepted submissions, we have a singular table
Each table is created like so:

CREATE TABLE <status>_submissions(
    rowid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    start_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
    num_qtr_hours INTEGER NOT NULL,
    supervisor_email INTEGER NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    organization TEXT NOT NULL,
    service_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    status INTEGER NOT NULL
);
